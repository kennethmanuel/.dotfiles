! Keycode 66 is 'capslock' in my keyboard and I don't use it so 
! I used it for alternative mod key for my window manager which is 'alt'.
! 'lock' needs to be cleared from xmodmap (run 'xmodmap' to see detail)
! to remap capslock to other mod key
! (Run 'xmodomap -pke' to see complete keycode list)
clear lock
keycode 66 = Super_L

! # This is good but fuck my dota
! keycode 64 = Mode_switch
! keycode 43 = h H Left H
! keycode 44 = j J Down J
! keycode 45 = k K Up K
! keycode 46 = l L Right L

! Keycode 135 is 'menu' key 
! for some reason sometimes this doesn't work after switching
! to my custom i3wm passthrough mode
! keycode 135 = Super_L

! Keycode 64 is 'alt' the real alt key in my keyboard 
! disabling for adapting capslock as alt key
